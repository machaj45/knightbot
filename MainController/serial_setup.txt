This file will guide you through installing rosserial-arduino onto ros workstation


Part 1: Serial comunication with ros node(arduino)

Instal rosserial:
	sudo apt-get install ros-indigo-rosserial-arduino  #Replace indigo with the name of the release you're installing from
	sudo apt-get install ros-indigo-rosserial          #Replace indigo with the name of the release you're installing from
	
After starting roscore, rosserial must be started
	rosrun rosserial_python serial_node.py /dev/ttyUSB0   #Might use diferent serial port, but 0 is good nitial guess.	





Part 2: Compiling arduino code on ros machine

Install arduino ide from https://www.arduino.cc/en/Guide/Linux
Install ros_lib for arduino:
	cd Arduino/libraries   #this should be the default path
	rm -rf ros_lib
	rosrun rosserial_arduino make_libraries.py .
This will make arduino libraries for standart msgs, services etc..., as well as any custom stuff inside ros workspace.
Standart libraries can also be installed through Arduino IDE library manager. Search for "rosserial".
